# NearSight

I wanted to make a platoformeresque style of game where the main mechanic is related to what you can see. Enter NearSight, the puzzle platformer where what you can not see is just as important as what you can. It follows our main characters, Nyx, a cat with terrible eyesight, and the Lantern, a spirit that guides Nyx throughout the city. Can you use your sight and mind to figure out how to get home? Or will you be consumed by the night?

I would like to get a lot more artwork for this project either done on my own time or commissioned by someone else, I would love for the graphics to be an immersive experience for players. I would also like to eventually implement a basic soundtrack, whether it be free sounds or from my own composition I would not know. In terms of the actual project I would hope to get a first level done by the end of february and hopefully have all mechanics completed by then (?). I also want to really emphasize the story element of this game and an eventual goal of mine is to get either myself or others to voice over all narrative pieces of the game.

Thanks to Micah Tien for drawing the background!
